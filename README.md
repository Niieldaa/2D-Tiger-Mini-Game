“In Hwacheon, where ancient spirits whispered through bamboo groves, Ki-Seok, a round, chubby tiger in a blue kimono and big red scarf, lived a laid-back life masking his kung fu mastery. His seemingly languid kung fu unfolded like a dance, each move showcasing precision. As ominous flames threatened, armed only with a stick, Ki-Seok embraced a deliberate journey…	 The battle against evil fire spirits had just begun!”

Introduction to ‘how to play.’
“Control Ki-Seok's every move as you explore the realm. Use the W, A, S, D keys to guide him. W to walk upwards, S to walk down, A for left and D for right to amble through the captivating landscapes of Hwacheon. Armed with nothing but a trusty stick, press the 'Spacebar' key to unleash Ki-Seok's kung fu prowess upon the evil fire spirits. Extinguish/Kill 10 Firespirits. May your journey be swift, and the flames be extinguished by the strength of our round, chubby kung fu master.”

This adventure game is based around the tiger Ki-Seok, in Korean it translates as “Energy Stone” in name mythology. Which is perfect for our chubby main character. He needs to kill the fire spirits, which was supposed to be summoned by our Villain Kuro the wolf. The player at this point of the game knows nothing about Kuro, yet. This is Future work and could be implemented later.
